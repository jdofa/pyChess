 - Overview -
The end goal for this project is to create the game of chess using pygame. I would like to further add on to this project by creating my own chess engine and adding an AI opponent. A very random thing I would like to also do would be to sort the chess board pieces by attaching a value according to its type and value.

Here I will keep track of current tasks and problems that should grow and become more semantic as I progress.


1. Make a chess grid.
2. Attach (x,y) coordinate values to be able to identify each square in the grid accordingly.
3. Load chess pieces to appropriate initial squares. 
4. Be able to move a chess piece to an unoccupied square.
