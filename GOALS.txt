 - Overview -
The end goal for this project is to create the game of chess using pygame. 
I would like to further add on to this project by creating my own chess engine 
and adding an AI opponent. A very random thing I would like to also do would be 
to sort the chess board pieces by attaching a value according to its type and value.

Here I will keep track of current tasks and problems.

1. Attach (x,y) coordinate values to be able to identify each square in the grid accordingly.
2. Load chess pieces to appropriate initial squares. 
3. Be able to move a chess piece to an unoccupied square.

Problems
1. Chess grid with imgages causes gaps. Added one pixel to width and height to fix issue.
It looks fine. Consider making a chess board without loading images.
Don't know if this may cause a weird looking board when I add window resizing option.
